    <h1>History of Bucket Cakes</h1>
    <p>Bucket Cakes was founded in 1971. It started as a baker's rebellion against small sized cupcakes, despite the belief that cupcakes are supposed to be cup-sized. It all started when our baker Tony baked a cupcake using a bucket as a baking sheet! Our building is a historical landmark in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. </p>
